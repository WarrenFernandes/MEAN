My MEAN To Do Application

A simple application designed to help track your TO DO items on a daily basis, in order to deploy the applications follow the simple steps
set out below:

1. Download and install MongoDB locally
2. Open the MongoDB folder and CMD in, run the mongod.exe and verify the DB is up and running
3. Open GIT BASH and git clone the repo
4. cd into the folder where the repo was cloned to and run "npm install" (installs all node modules)
5. Run "npm start" and the application will start up

Thank you!
